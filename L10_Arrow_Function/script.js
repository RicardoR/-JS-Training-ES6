/*Refactoring Keyword Functions*/

/*The function below uses the 'function' keyword.  There's nothing wrong with using the 'function' keyword here, but it might look a bit nicer if we refactor it to use the fat arrow syntax instead.

Refactor the code below to use a fat arrow function.  Remember the rules of fat arrow functions:

If the function has a single expression in its body, the curly braces and 'return' keyword can be removed
If the function has a single argument, the parentheses around the argument list can be removed*/

const fibonacci = (n) => {
  if (n < 3) return 1;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}


/*Arrow Functions Aren't Always a Solution

/*Arrow functions bind the value of 'this' to the surrounding context, and sometimes this isn't the behavior we expect.
The code below has an object that represents a users profile.  The profile has a 'name' currently.
Add another key to this object called 'getName'.
'getName' should be a function that returns the profiles name, using 'this.name'.
Does the solution work with a fat arrow function or will you have to use a function keyword instead?*/

const profile = {
    name: 'Alex',
  	getName: function(){
    	return this.name;
    }
};

profile.getName();
