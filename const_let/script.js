/*A Constant Exercise of Letting Variables Be Variables*/

/*Imagine that you are building an application to manage a user's Facebook profile.  A profile might have a 'name', 'age', and 'dateOfBirth'.
Declare three variables with these same names, making sure to use 'const' or 'let' depending on whether you expect the value to change over time.*/

const name = 'Ricardo';
const dateOfBirth = '21/04/1981';
let age = 35;
