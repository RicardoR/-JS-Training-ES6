/*The code below is calling 'savePost' three times, but it is doing so using a for loop.
This implementation works, but the for loop makes it more challenging to understand the purpose of the function.
Rather than using a for loop, refactor the code below to instead use the forEach helper.*/

/*The array below contains an array of objects, each of which is a representation of an image.
Using the forEach helper, calculate the area of each image and store it in a new array called 'areas'.
